<h1>Question 1</h1>
I geniually just guessed because I was too lazy to take my notes out.
<h2>Question 4</h2>
I thought that syntax formed a set of symbols because of the role symbols play in representing elements.
<h3>Question 11</h3>
I thought that all illegal variable names had to have an upercase but I was wrong.
<h4>Question 14</h4>
I did not remeber what the # symbol meant.
<h5>Question 17</h5>
I accidently thought that the code had to have a double equal sign.
<h6>Question 18</h6>
This question I got wrong because of the same reason as Question 17.
