<h1>Question 9</h1>
I only ran the code three times in my notebook and did not run in python so I could see that it was an infinite code.
<h2>Question 13</h2>
I did the mod division wrong.
<h3>Question 15</h3>
I calculated the for j in range wrong as I didn't fully understand it.
<h4>Question 16</h4>
I got this wrong because I didn't understand how to do the for j in range at the time I did this question.
