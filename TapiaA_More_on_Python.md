# More on Python Prompts

## 1) What extension do all Python files have?
All Python files have the .py extension.
## 2) What is the current version of Python?
The current version of Python is Python 3. Example: New developed features for Python 3 are compatible to use for older versions of Python 3.
## 6) Describe potential compatibility issues with different versions of Python.  For example what happens if you try to run a program program written in Python 3.xx on a Python 2.xx interpreter?  What happens if you try to run a program written in Python 2.xx on a Python 3.xx interpreter?  What if you try to run a newer Python 3.xx program on an older Python 3.xx interpreter?  What happens if you try to run an older Python 3.xx program on a newer Python 3.xx interpreter?
If I ran a program written for Python 3 on Python 2 then a error would appear because I can not use a program written for a new programming language on a old programming language.
## 7) Describe five different implementations of Python.  What language is each built on?  Which is the default implementation of Python?
Five different implemntations for Python are: CPython, PyPy, Jython, Cython, and RPython. CPython is built using the language C, Jython is built using Java, PyPy is written in RPython, Cython is written in C, and RPython can be written in C. CPython is the default implementation of Python.
