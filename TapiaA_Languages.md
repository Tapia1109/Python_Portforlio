#Programming Languages Review Prompts
#1)Explain how a computer might break down complex tasks, such as calculating your grade, into a series of simple operations.
A computer might break down complex tasks like calculating my grade by adding up my assigned work and dividing it which then gives me the average of that class.
#2)What is an instruction list?
An instruction list is a complete set of demands.
#3)What is a program?
A program is what allows the computer to apply what we tell it to apply.
#4)Describe how computing devices physically store data.
Computing devices convert the data into binary numbers(1s and 0s) and is then stored into storages like hard drives.
#5)Explain how a computing devivce would store numerical data
A computing device would store numerical data by converting the numbers into binary.
#6)Explain how a computing device would store a character.
A computing device would store a character by again converting the characters into 1s and 0s(binary).
#7)Explain how a computing device would store the color of a pixel.
A computing device would convert a pixel into three bytes and using RGB it would then convert the bytes into binary numbers.
#8)Describe what machine language is.
Machine language is the language in which computers communicate and is easier for computers to understand but harder for humans to understand.
#9)Describe what natural languages are and provide at least two examples of a natural language.
Natural languages are the language that humans speak and is easier for humans to understand but harder for computers to understand. Two examples of a natural language are English and Spanish.
#10)Describe what a low level programming language is and provide at least two examples of a low level language.
A low level programing language is a type of language we use to code that is harder for humans to understand. Two examples are c++ and Pascal.
#11)Describe what a high level programming language is and provide at least two examples of a high level language.
A high level programming language is a language that is close to natural languages which means it is easier for humans to understand. Two examples are JavaScript and Python.
#12)Rank the following types of languages in order from most human friendly (least computer friendly) to most computer friendly (least human friendly): Asssembly Language, Natural Language, Machine Language, High Level Programming Language, Low Level Programming Language.
Natural Language, High Level, Low Level, Assembly, and Machine Language.
#13)What are the four fundamental elements of language?  Describe each.  Where appropriate, include examples in your descriptions.
The elements are an alphabet(letters used to create words in a specific language), syntax(rules that say if a string a words that form a sentence is written right), Semantics(rules that say if a sentence makes sense), and lexis(a set of words that is given to the user).
