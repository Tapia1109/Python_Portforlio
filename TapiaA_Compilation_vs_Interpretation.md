# Compilation vs Interpretation Review Prompts

## 1) What is the purpose of compiling and/or interpreting programs?
The purpose is to use these methods to convert programming languages into machine language.
## 2) Describe the compilation process.
Source code is translated into an executtable file(.exe) that is run after translation.
## 3) Describe the interpretation process.
Source code is translated one line at a time and is executed and translated one line at a time.
## 4) Provide two examples of compiled programming languages.
Java and C
## 5) Provide two examples of interpreted programming languages.
Pytyhon and JavaScript
## 6) Explain the key difference between compiled programming languages and interpreted programming languages?
Compiled programming language translates the whole source code while interpreted progrqmming langugae translates the source code one line at a time.
## 7) What are the advantages of compiled programming languages?
It's faster and the code is in machine language which means it keeps any programming language.
## 8) What are the disadvantages of compiled programming languages?
Takes a lot of time to run the code after. Have to put as many compilers as hardware websites you want the code to be run on.
## 9) What are the advantages of interpreted programming languages?
The code can be ran as soon as you complete it and you don't have to compile your code because it can be run using machine language.
## 10) What are the disadvantages of interpreted programming languages?
It's not really fast because the code shares the same power as the computer.
## 11) Explain what source code is.
Source code is the code humans type in using high level programmin language.
## 12) Explain what a script is.
A script is a source code that is for interpreted language.
